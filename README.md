# My-First-Project
hey !! This is my first ever project I have made using DSA. Sudoku is a popular logic-based puzzle game consisting of a 9x9 grid divided into nine 3x3 subgrids. The objective is to fill each of the empty cells with digits from 1 to 9 in such a way that every row, every column, and every subgrid contains all the digits from 1 to 9 without repetition.
The basic idea behind backtracking is to perform a depth-first search through the solution space, backtracking whenever we encounter an invalid partial solution. By exploring different possibilities and discarding incorrect paths, we ultimately reach a valid solution or conclude that no solution exists.
To implement the Sudoku solver using backtracking I use a very simple implementation which is very friendly to beginners.
Hope this is helpful to you....
