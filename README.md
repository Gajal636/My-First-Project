Introduction
Sudoku is a popular logic-based puzzle game consisting of a 9x9 grid divided into nine 3x3 subgrids. The objective is to fill each of the empty cells with digits from 1 to 9 in such a way that every row, every column, and every subgrid contains all the digits from 1 to 9 without repetition.

Backtracking Algorithm
Backtracking is a powerful algorithmic technique used to find solutions to combinatorial problems. It explores all possible candidates for a solution by incrementally building it and undoing incorrect choices along the way.

The basic idea behind backtracking is to perform a depth-first search through the solution space, backtracking whenever we encounter an invalid partial solution. By exploring different possibilities and discarding incorrect paths, we ultimately reach a valid solution or conclude that no solution exists.
